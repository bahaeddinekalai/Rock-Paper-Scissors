# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "rock paper scissors". It was created as part of the Foundations Course on [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com).

## Description

The game is played from the browser console, and the user can choose between three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will also randomly choose one of the three options, and the winner will be determined according to the classic rules: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beat paper, or a tie.
The game will display the winner or a tie.

## Future Improvements

This is a basic version of the game, In a later version, we will add a graphical user interface with buttons and text. Stay tuned for updates!

## Usage

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser, and open the browser console. You will be prompted to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and the result of the round will be displayed in the console.
